A utility to create a signature and hash of a signed string for use with the https://github.com/pingleware/pingleware-contracts project.

# EOL or End-of-Life

When a piece of software is useful, there should never be an EOL doctrine. The intention for this application is to achieve immoratlity ;).

At some point of time in the future, this project may appear to be dead and abandon. The opposite will be true!

When this project reaches that stage, this project has matured to a level where maintenance is minimal (mostly updating to latest version of Node).
